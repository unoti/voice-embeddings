    "- N is a \"Negative\" image--a picture of a different person than the Anchor image.\n",

    "* For step 4 you will sum over the training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Hints\n",
    "* Recall that the square of the L2 norm is the sum of the squared differences: $||x - y||_{2}^{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_{i} - y_{i})^{2}$\n",
    "* Note that the `anchor`, `positive` and `negative` encodings are of shape `(m,128)`, where m is the number of training examples and 128 is the number of elements used to encode a single example.\n",
    "* For steps 1 and 2, you will maintain the number of `m` training examples and sum along the 128 values of each encoding. \n",
    "[tf.reduce_sum](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/reduce_sum) has an `axis` parameter.  This chooses along which axis the sums are applied.  \n",
    "* Note that one way to choose the last axis in a tensor is to use negative indexing (`axis=-1`).\n",
    "* In step 4, when summing over training examples, the result will be a single scalar value.\n",
    "* For `tf.reduce_sum` to sum across all axes, keep the default value `axis=None`."
